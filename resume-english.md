## Working experience
**Bold** are stuffs familiar to me and ~~Strikethrough~~ are something we were not using any more.
### General Data Technology Co., Ltd, `2015 Apr` ~
#### Shujuguan(shujuguan.cn), `2015 Apr` ~
* Internet plus data analysis product(SaaS), which aimed to be a competitor to `SiSence` and `DataHero`. Agile Team, Scrum and Kanban.
* Agile Git branching model: Every `Sprint`(per 2 weeks), we created feature branch and maintenance branch from `master` branch, for merging new features and hotfix respectively.
* **User Stories:** backend service(data type recognition, third party datasource support, unit test, machine learning, etc.), help our team migrate from SVN to Git, Baidu location API service based on Node.js.
* **App Stacks:** **Spring MVC**, **JUnit**, **Findbugs**, **Apache POI**, **Spark**, `Morphia`, `Logback`, `jOOQ`, `ActiveMQ`, `ThinkPHP`, `Guzzle`, ~~Discuz!~~, `OpenCenter`, `Wordpress`, **Express**, **Babel**, `TypeScript`, `Backbone`, `Highcharts`, ~~ECharts~~, `Underscore`
* **Data Stacks:** **MongoDB**, `GBase 8a`, `Redis`, `MySQL`
* **DevOps Stacks:** **GitLab**, ~~SVN~~, **Asana**, **Jenkins**, ~~Ant~~, **Maven**, `LAMP`, `nginx`, `Grunt`, **Gulp**, **ELK**, **Docker**, `aliyun`
* **Conclusion:** This was my first in the Internet industry.

### ANHUI WANTONG TECHNOLOGY Co.,Ltd, Taijin Research Center, `2012 Nov` ~ `2015 Apr`
#### ANHUI Expressway Toll Collection System, `2012 Nov` ~ `2014 Jan`
* Enterprise software. I was assigned to maintain the hardware interface and develop new features according to the demand.
* Technically involved such as serial port, custom TCP protocol and calling the Dynamic Libraries.
* **Stacks:** **C#(.NET 4.0)**, **WinForm**, `SQL Server`, `SVN`, `JIRA`
* **Conclusion:** In this period of work, I have learned developing enterprise software using `C#`, Version Control with `SVN` and team collaboration through `JIRA`.

#### ANHUI Expressway Toll Collection System Flat Version, `2014 Jan` ~ `2015 Apr`
* This was a newer and larger version of previous project which including the whole system. Pure Java, and we switched the main running environment from Windows to Linux.
* I was participated in design and development of the toll part. I was committed to design and implement the entire hardware interface, `Windows`/`Linux` platform compatibility and data transition between new and old system.
* The whole device layer implemented with multi-thread and asynchronous callback. Each kind of device has an execution thread，and there was one status thread monitoring all execution threads, releasing resources and handling exception if necessary. Most of the interface were asynchronous, notifying the workflow through callback event.
* Troubleshooting some technical issues, e.g., analyzing JVM heapdump to find out memory leak; using `jmc`, `jvisualvm` to monitor JVM status, modifying device driver code to improve JNA call.
* **Stacks:** **Spring**, **Maven**, **Hudson**, **Findbugs**, **Xuggle**, **SWT**, **AWT**, **LINQ**, `H2`, `Activiti`, `Kafka`, `Sigar`, `SVN`, `JIRA`, `SQL Server`
* **Conclusion:** This period gave me a comprehensive experience of a Java project, from design to trail run, I was part of it. But due to lots of business trip(130+ days a year) and overtime working climate, sadly, I left this company.
